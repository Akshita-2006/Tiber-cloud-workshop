# 💼 Loan Approval Predictor 

A beginner-friendly machine learning project to predict loan approval status using a Random Forest Classifier. Built with Python, Streamlit, and basic data visualization libraries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This app uses a dataset of loan applicants to:

- Visualize trends (e.g. education vs loan status, income vs loan amount)
- Predict whether a loan will be **approved or rejected**
- Highlight key features influencing the prediction

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data handling  
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning  
- **Streamlit** – web app interface  

---

## 🔎 Key Steps

1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Visualize key insights  
3. Encode categorical data  
4. Train/test split and model building  
5. Evaluate performance  
6. Display results and plots via Streamlit  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run your_script_name.py
```

---

## ✅ Output

- Model accuracy
- Classification report
- Visualizations (loan status trends, income vs loan, feature importance)

---

## 💡 Notes

- This is a beginner-level project for learning and exploration  
- Data cleaning is minimal; column names include leading spaces  
- Ideal for understanding basic ML workflows and Streamlit integration
